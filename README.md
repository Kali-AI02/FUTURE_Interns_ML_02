# Sentiment Analysis Project
# Overview
This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the model helps in understanding public opinions and reviews, which can be useful for businesses and researchers.

# Dataset
